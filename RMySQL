The basic process is described here, but there are several hints, So I will describe the whole solution (please change the R version and paths if needed):

Install R
Install latest RTools 
Install MySQL (Community server)
Install Cygwin 
Add cygwin (C:\cygwin64\bin)and RTools (C:RTools\bin)  to the PATH of system variable under environment variables 
Create a new environment variable MYSQL_HOME with value C:/Program Files/MySQL/MySQL Server 5.7/
copy libmysql.dll to C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin from C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib
copy libmysql.dll to C:\Program Files\R\R-2.12.1\bin (Ooptional)
run install.packages('RMySQL',type='source') and wait while compilation will end.
check by running libraty(RMySQL)
